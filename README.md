# GEPSharp
Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is a variety of genetic programming that differs significantly from John Kozaâ€™s original version (GP).  For this project, a library entitled GEPsharp was written in C#, implementing both GEP and GP.  Then the library was tested on four traditional genetic programming sample problems.  Results for GEP and GP were compared, and GEP was found to be faster, but no more effective.  Additional features for the library which are not part of the original GP or GEP description were added and tested on the same sample problems.

Note that .gv files are graph description files, and can be opened with an appropriate viewing software, such as GraphViz.
